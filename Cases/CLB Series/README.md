# CLB Series DIY Eurorack Cases
## Prototype 1

These are the manufacturing files for the Sonic Athameâ„¢ CLB Series "Cheap Laser Box" eurorack cases. These cases allow you to create your own quality eurorack case for under $50 in raw materials. The case has been designed to be easy to manufacture and assemble, with the least amount of hardware like screws and bolts.

All files have millimeters (mm) as units. Make sure to check the unit when importing these files!

[The source design files are here, in the free in-browser 3D CAD program OnShape!](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/52b1527c498b44ef96553bf5/w/5b2e965aacd5aa42ad99e6d7/e/95825469f7cf856dc3c79d39)

The majority of the case is 1/4" plywood, which is cut on a laser cutter. The rails themselves are 3D printed without supports and are secured to the plywood using the same M3 square nuts which are inserted into the rails to screw modules into. The rails use 10mm M3 machine screws to attach to the case, one every 12HP. The rails are designed for 8mm M3 screws, but can accommodate up to 10mm screws (without washers) and may just barely work with 6mm (without washers) as well.

Bill Of Materials
- 2x Side Panels
- 2x Rail Panels (HP specific)
- 1x Bottom Panel (HP Specific)
- 1x Back Panel (HP Specific)
- 2x 3D Printed Rails (HP Specific)
  - You can also use smaller rails next to each other. They come in 12HP increments, and my printer can only go up to 24HP. So for a 60HP case, I need to use 4x 24HP rails and 2x 12HP rails
- (Case HP / 6)x 10mm M3 Bolts + Washers + Square Nuts
  - For a 60HP case, you would need 10x bolt+washer+nut combos.
  - The square nuts are the same used inside the rails.
- As many M3 Square nuts and 8mm bolts as you need to secure all of your modules
